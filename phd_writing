Paper Writing

 
1. Write generative text every day, (write as you would speak), and write questions as a reader while you write. 
2. Star ideation (draw diagram of your thoughts to organise what you want to write)
3. (https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/papers/phd_paper_writing.pdf)
4. (http://www.raulpacheco.org/2013/02/improving-your-academic-writing-my-top-10-tips/)
5. Every sentence should have a subject, verb and object (Remember that the subject names what the sentence is about, the verb tells what the subject does or is, and the object receives the action of the verb)
6. Each paragraph tense consistent.
7. Capitalization consistency:  It is “continuation method” not “Continuation method” or “Continuation Method”, and were other words that were similarly inconsistent.  I fixed what I noticed, but you should check again.
8. Hyphenation:  It is “hyper-parameter” not “hyper parameter” or “hyperparameter”, and things like this.
9. Equation references:  Equations should be “bare” references, such as “as one can see in (57)” and not “as one can see in equation (57)” nor “as one can see in Equation-(57)”.  I fixed many of these, but there might be more.
10. Check few incorrect bibtex entries, [formatting] 
11. “This” should always have something following it. “This regression shows that....” is fine.
12. “Where” refers to a place. “In which” refers to a model
13. Don’t abbreviate authors’ names
14. Don’t overuse italics. (I use them far too much.) It’s best to use them only when the emphasis in a sentence would otherwise not be clear — but maybe then you should rewrite the sentence so that the emphasis really is clear
15. Take responsibility of your writing (as much as you can)
16. Organization of paper in the sense of introduction (example: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf)
